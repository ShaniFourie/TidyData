# TidyData
The data presented originate from a field survey undertaken in April-May 2019. The aim of the study was to assess how disturbance (bait collecting and trampling) influence trophic niches of sandprawns. The data presented in this workshhet are delta carbon and delta nitrogen values of sandprawns across 4 different sites (see Site labels for clarification) The data presented in the subsequent worksheets are delta carbon and delta nitrogen values of (1) plants, (2) particulate organic matter and microphytobenthos and (3) sediment across 4 different sites. Isotopic niches are determined using delat Carbon and Nitrogen values
